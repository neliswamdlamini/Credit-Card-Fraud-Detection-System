# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System
Bachelor of Computer Science Degree Capstone project 

**Topic: Credit Card Fraud Dete ction using Machine learning**
The project contains a machine learning model that was trained on credit card transaction data so that it can be able to detect any fraudulent transactions on new credit card transaction data. 
It has been implemented in Python as a web application using the Flask library and while the model for classification was trained using Jupyter Notebook then the dataset a CSV file. 
A user interface is seen upon runningh the project whereby new data can then be inserted.

**How to run project:**
Open the main file in Spyder then run, a browser Tab will be automatically opened for the system.
